# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - A Compilation of Examples
This is a collection of small projects covering different topics in A.I. and M.L. to be used as a training resource for students. Some of the projects were collected from online resources and adapted, and some are original projects:

- [Deep Artificial Neural Network for Regression](/deep-ann-for-regression/deep_ann_for_regression.ipynb): This application focuses on ANN for determining housing prices on a large dataset. The ANN can be easily improved/modified for deeper and wider configuration.
- [XGBoost with Amazon AWS SageMaker](/xgboost-with-amazon-sagemaker/SageMakerTutorialRev001.ipynb): 
- Object detection with R-CNN: This is the region proposal based CNN to identify/localize objects within an image. Uses VGG16
- [Object detection with YOLOv4](/object-detection-with-yolov4/YOLO_object_detection.ipynb): Uses YOLOv4 to classify and localize buses and trucks. Builds upon available code from other GitHub repositories.
- [Anomaly detection of credit card transactions using autoencoders](/anomaly-detection-of-credit-card-transactions-using-autoencoders/anomaly_detection_credit_card_transaction_autoencoder.ipynb
): We are trying to differentiate between normal and abnormal credit card transactions. The reconstruction error scores toguether with threshold are used to help us identify an anomaly. 
- [Sentiment Analysis on Twitter](/sentiment-analysis/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb): We look at a couple thounsands of tweets and test Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) to try to predict if a tweet is likely to contain Fake News.

## Software Development:
- [Futures market algorithmic trading system](/algo-trading-system): This quite simple algo was developed in TradeStation EasyLanguage to trade Wheat futures 420 minutes time frame. It was developed in 2017 using walk-forward and monte carlo techniques, incubate in 2018, live for 2019-2020 and retired in 2021 when it hit its pre defined stop/retirement point.
- [Game Developement with A.I. Integration](/rocket-booster-sandbox): A simple 3D game developed using Unit3D and coded on C# (.net) with two basic levels. This is a sandbox for testing A.I. integration using different techniques. Compiled for WebGL. 

## Other Resources:
- Python Pandas/Numpy Cheat Sheet: Selection of interesting tools and tricks. By no means comprehensive but a good way to refresh concepts. 
- Coding Interview Questions: Those have been gathered by me and other students/friends/coworkers over the time and added here. Only actual code interview questions are allowed in this notebook.
