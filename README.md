# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - A Compilation of Examples
This is a collection of small projects covering different topics in A.I. and M.L. to be used as a training resource for students. Some of the projects were collected from online resources and adapted, and some are original projects:

- XGBoost with Amazon AWS SageMaker: 
- Object detection with R-CNN: This is the region proposal based CNN to identify/localize objects within an image. Uses VGG16
- Object detection with YOLOv4: Uses YOLOv4 to classify and localize buses and trucks. Builds upon available code from other GitHub repositories.
- Anomaly detection of credit card transactions using autoencoders: We are trying to differentiate between normal and abnormal credit card transactions. The reconstruction error scores toguether with threshold are used to help us identify an anomaly. 

## Other Resources:
- Python Pandas/Numpy Cheat Sheet: Selection of interesting tools and tricks. By no means comprehensive but a good way to refresh concepts. 
- Coding Interview Questions: Those have been gathered by me and other students/friends/coworkers over the time and added here. Only actual code interview questions are allowed in this notebook.
